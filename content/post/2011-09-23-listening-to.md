Nos gusta porque denuncia las mismas cuestiones contra las que luchamos: posición de control abusiva, ya sea por parte de multinacionales o de gobiernos.

<a title="https://youtu.be/A1AQaXUCboQ" href="https://youtu.be/A1AQaXUCboQ" target="_blank">The Jams: We make the standards</a>

Oh we make the standards and we make the rules
  
And if you don‘t abide by them you must be a fool
  
We have the power to control the whole land
  
You never must question our motives or plans –
  
‘Cause we‘ll outlaw your voices, do anything we want
  
We‘ve nothing to fear from the nation
  
We‘ll kick you out of your houses if you get too much
  
If we have to we‘ll destroy your generation

‘Cause we‘ve built up a frontage and we‘ve gained respect
  
There‘s no one to endanger our position –

Standards rule OK
  
Standards rule OK
  
Standards rule OK
  
Standards rule OK

And we don‘t like people who stand in our way
  
Awareness is gonna be redundant
  
And ignorance is strength, we have God on our side
  
Look, you know what happend to Winston
