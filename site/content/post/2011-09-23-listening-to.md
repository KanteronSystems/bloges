Nos gusta porque denuncia las mismas cuestiones contra las que luchamos: posici√≥n de control abusiva, ya sea por parte de multinacionales o de gobiernos.

<a title="http://youtu.be/A1AQaXUCboQ" href="http://youtu.be/A1AQaXUCboQ" target="_blank">The Jams: We make the standards</a>

Oh we make the standards and we make the rules
  
And if you don&#8217;t abide by them you must be a fool
  
We have the power to control the whole land
  
You never must question our motives or plans &#8211;
  
&#8216;Cause we&#8217;ll outlaw your voices, do anything we want
  
We&#8217;ve nothing to fear from the nation
  
We&#8217;ll kick you out of your houses if you get too much
  
If we have to we&#8217;ll destroy your generation

&#8216;Cause we&#8217;ve built up a frontage and we&#8217;ve gained respect
  
There&#8217;s no one to endanger our position &#8211;

Standards rule OK
  
Standards rule OK
  
Standards rule OK
  
Standards rule OK

And we don&#8217;t like people who stand in our way
  
Awareness is gonna be redundant
  
And ignorance is strength, we have God on our side
  
Look, you know what happend to Winston
